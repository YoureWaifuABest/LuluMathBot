# LuluMathBot
Discord bot to do basic League of Legends related math and output League of Legends related stats. 

## Current features:
1. Lethality, armor, and magic resistance calculations
2. Basic damage calculator (damage * resist essentially)
3. Outputs Champion specific data (stats, lore, etc.)
4. Item information lookup
5. Print winrate of summoners
6. Print current challenger players
7. Can clear the channel
  + This requires appropriate permissions
  - Included because I've been too lazy to make a second bot
8. Will respond to certain phrases (for fun)
9. Some other fun phrases (8ball, rng)

7 & 8 will be seperated into seperate bots eventually. Or maybe not.

## Dependencies
1. Python3.5+
2. discord.py

## Installation
1. `git clone [this repo]`
2. Add your bot's token to bottoken.py
3. Add your Riot API token to apitoken.py
4. Launch it and it'll probably work.
